### Description

- This is the api for url shortner , it has a post and a get method . 
  It was written in GO and uses mysql as a db in order to fetch the k-v for the small link to the generated link.
- The Id logic works by using uint in the database , but for the front end it's encoded in base 62 so we can get a smaller looking string. 
   - forexample
      - if the db id for the link was 1000001
      - the return value to the front end client would be 4C93 , this way we can access the url as domain.com/4C93
